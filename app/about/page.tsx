        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At DokaLab, we believe in the transformative power of technology when combined with creativity and critical thinking.
          Our mission is to explore the intersection of various technology domains and share valuable insights with the community.

        <h2>The Story Behind DokaLab</h2>
        <p>
          DokaLab was founded in 2023 with a simple yet ambitious goal: to create a space where complex technical concepts
          could be presented in an accessible and practical manner. What started as a personal blog has evolved into a 
          platform dedicated to knowledge sharing and community building.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The name &ldquo;DokaLab&rdquo; combines &ldquo;Documentation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Laboratory&rdquo; - representing our dual commitment to 
          documenting knowledge and experimenting with new ideas.
        </p>

      <section className={styles.aboutSection}>
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          We approach technology with a holistic perspective, recognizing that the most innovative solutions often emerge 
          at the intersection of different domains. Whether it's combining machine learning with web development or
          exploring how system design principles can inform UI/UX decisions, we believe in breaking down silos between
          technological disciplines.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our content is guided by three core principles:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Depth without complexity</strong> - Exploring topics thoroughly without unnecessary jargon</li>
          <li><strong>Practice over theory</strong> - Focusing on practical applications and real-world examples</li>
          <li><strong>Community-driven learning</strong> - Valuing diverse perspectives and collaborative knowledge creation</li>
        </ul>
